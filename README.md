# Astec 3DRotate Test

A super beta test of using vanilla JavaScript to spin a series of images around in semi-realistic 3d with both touch and mouse inputs.

## Project Description

The VueJS Home.vue Component contains a complex JavaScript script which returns data-bound positions specifying an exact image name. The image is loaded into the viewport. This creates a semi-realistic 3D "product" view. The images can be zoomed in or out with a slider. There are many default variables which can be controlled. This script relies on XY coordinates from input and HTML5 canvas.

see the package.json for npm run scripts.
